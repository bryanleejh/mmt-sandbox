# MMT Component Design System

A collection of design resources and reusable components for creating a cohesive design across the Foodpanda Marketing Platform.
You can read more about this project on [Confluence](https://confluence.deliveryhero.com/display/GLOBAL/MMT+Component+Design+System).


## Getting Started

### Installing

To use the design system in your project.

```
yarn add --save @deliveryhero/mmt-design-system
```

### Working with styles
This package provides a compiled css file that you must include in your root file.
```js
    import '@deliveryhero/mmt-design-system/build/styles.css';
```

If you need access to variables, include the `variables.scss` file in your `scss` files.

```js
    @import '@deliveryhero/mmt-design-system/build/variables.scss';
```

You can also read the variables from your javascript files.
```js
import { Tokens } from 'mmt-design-system';

console.log(Tokens.ColorBrand800);

```

### Overriding tokens
You may need to use a different brand color or font family. You can declare the tokens in your project and the DS will use them.
This is an example of how to override the brand color:
```css
:root {
  --color-brand-100: #fae8eb;
  --color-brand-200: #f5d1d8;
  --color-brand-300: #f1b9c4;
  --color-brand-400: #eca2b1;
  --color-brand-500: #d57da1;
  --color-brand-600: #d54883;
  --color-brand-700: #d70f63;
  --color-brand-800: #911029;
  --color-brand-900: #680c1e;
```
This is the full list of available tokens.
Note that javascript declarations are read-only and won't be overridden and you need to do it separately.
